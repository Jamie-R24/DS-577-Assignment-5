# DS 577 Assignment 5

## Machine Learning on Side-Channel Attacks
## Due date: April 29, 2025
In this project you are expected to analyze the side-channel data obtained from web browser
profiling. In the experiment, the data is collected from Performance counters to classify 40
different websites in Tor browser. The data for training and test can be downloaded from here:
[github repo](https://github.com/bgulmezoglu/PerfWeb)

The explanation of the data also can be found in the README.md file.
You are encouraged to review the following paper which describes the experiments:

[original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04437.pdf)

The goal is to replicate the study by implementing various Machine/Deep Learning techniques,
e.g. kNN, Decision Tree, SVM, AutoEncoder, CNN, Ensemble, Random Forest, Naive Bayes
etc. You are supposed to use at least 5 different techniques of your choice. You can use
Matlab,Python and other programming languages.
Your report should contain the table with the success rates of ML techniques. For example,

| ML/DL | Type Success Rate |
| kNN | xx% |
| Decision Tree | xx% |
| SVM | xx% |
| AutoEncoder | xx% |
| Ensemble | xx% |

Please, also include the code you used for the experiments.
